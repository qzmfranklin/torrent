# Rules and loaded here are preluded, as explained here:

#
# CAVEATS:
#
#       This content of this file is prepended to each BUILD file in this
#       project.  As a result, it must be full path to reference targets.
#
#       You may refrence external repositories here with the @<repo_name>
#       convention.
#
#       To reference a file stored in this repository, you must preped the at
#       sign, '@', to the full path.  This is a nuance found in this thread:
#               https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bazel-discuss/sG5G5eMFYYA
