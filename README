Enterprise file sharing powered by BitTorrent.


This project solves the problem of distributing files across an enterprise
network.  Imagined problems:
    1.  The Continuous Integration (CI) system builds large artifacts every day,
        deploying those artifacts to the production cluster using ssh, http, or
        ftp is usually too slow as it is very likely to encounter network
        bottleneck issues.
    2.  Mission critical, yet large (binary) files must be synchronized to
        sites across the globe.  Transcontinenal links are usually too narrow
        and flakey for conventional methods to work efficiently and reliably.


Why BitTorrent?
    1.  BitTorrent is designed to solve problems exactly like the ones described
        above.  It relieves much of the stress on the network bandwidth by
        enabling peer-to-peer transmission of packets.  Topologically, the data
        will propagate as fast as it can given the network condition.
    2.  BitTorrent is battle tested.  There have been numerous production
        quality BitTorrent clients developed for various platforms.  It has been
        proven as performant and reliable for file sharing purposes.
    3.  BitTorrent is fully open source.
