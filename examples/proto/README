This directory demonstrates using protobuf in Java and C++.


The .proto files in this directory are modified from the following git repository:
        https://github.com/cgrushko/proto_library


A few flags are tuned to make the X_proto_library rules search for the correct
language specific toolchains, by adding the following few lines to .bazelrc:
    ```
    build --proto_compiler=//third_party/cc/protobuf:protoc
    build --proto_toolchain_for_cc=//third_party/cc/protobuf:cc_toolchain
    build --proto_toolchain_for_java=//third_party/cc/protobuf:java_toolchain
    ```

You can look at the default values for these flags:
    bazel help build | grep protobuf


How to run python protobuf?

    The python runtime is located at third_party/protobuf/python/google, or may
    be installed via `sudo pip3 install protobuf`.  It supports python 2.6, 2.7,
    3.3, and 3.4.  It is known to be very slow in implementation and is an
    ongoing effort.
