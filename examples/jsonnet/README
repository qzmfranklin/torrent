This directory stores the various examples from the jsonnet official tutorial:
        https://jsonnet.org/learning/tutorial.html

On macOS, you can get the `jsonnet` package via homebrew:
        brew install jsonnet

On Ubuntu, I have not tried to find a good way to install `jsonnet`.

The Makefile in this directory allows you to run all the necessary tests.  You
can follow through the test_output/ directory to see the results.
